weird dotted lines on canvas on mobile
timeouts on fullscreen??
need fromFullScreenCanvas in case of ESC instead of pressing button
some indication that the other box will move, like dotted green lines?
check if other places for highlights needed
check highlighting code
update draw fn from new one
can't reproduce: mobile crop box up left cornere not working
does startcrop init activecropbox and currentHandle and movableboxes
