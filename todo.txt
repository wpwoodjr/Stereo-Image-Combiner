timeouts on fullscreen??
need fromFullScreenCanvas in case of ESC instead of pressing button
need to updatemovableboxes on entering and exiting fullscreen mode.
fullscreen on Firefox does weird things with moving the image down, does Chrome?

clean up code that checks clamp mode before allowing box to move

clean up clamp stuff

cursor changes on mobile?
^^^^^^^ try on chromebook
desktop, crop / resize, mobile, desktop, cancel, crop - crop window too small
^^^^^^^ try on chromebook

why do both boxes blink when moving both outside
    // seems weird that only am setting axtiveCB in tweakXY
    // mismatch happens after diag movement, returning to vert or horizontal in final analysis

scroll bar moves header to left

Crop, since gap gets smaller on geese, scale size is too small, not optimal, can't even get it bigger with resize
Crop geese, change display size, put back to max, handles go green when should be gray
white streak down left goose left side when change display size down by one then increase again
  ff, 179% scale gap 7.5%



check touch mode



This line is wrong:         cropBoxes[RIGHT].width = Math.max(minSize, Math.min(cropBoxes[RIGHT].width, rightImgStart + img2Width - cropBoxes[RIGHT].x));
  shouldn't have rightImgStart
