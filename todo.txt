Update readme

somehow got to state where left cropbox was below right cropbox... start in a mode, shake both images in align mode sometimes does it.
  may have to do with y height correction
  tab with arrow down when moving left cropbox does it
related? unnecessary?
        // prevent cropbox handles from being hidden when images are cut off at the top
related? check fixCropAfterAlignMode

========== Maybe later ==========
only look at some mouse movements to decrease CPU?

review alignMode code, esp fixcrop and drawing routines (need 3?)

move other box in side by side mode, like in align mode?

*Fullscreen*
f for FS interface?
fullscreen on Firefox does weird things with moving the image down, does Chrome?
fs generally takes scalePercent from current mode, should it just be full screen at 100% scale?
need to updatemovableboxes on entering and exiting fullscreen mode.
  well how do onScaleChange and onSwap do it without calling movableboxes?

lines on shadow, maybe due to off by one issue?  timing?

want slow movement on resize handles?

duplicate tab in a mode or after a crop, display scale is from a mode or cropped scale, eg 72 instead of 100

iOS may need to call onResize after a timeout, as documented in MB:
    // ios is not always reporting correct width and height on orientation change
    // use timeout to redo the resize after things have hopefully settled down

cursor changes on mobile? esp. with touch
^^^^^^^ try on chromebook
desktop, crop / resize, mobile, desktop, cancel, crop - crop window too small
^^^^^^^ try on chromebook

*Align Mode*
need better indicators of what will move in align mode, esp arrow mode
  for instance the transparency isn't a clear indicator
  in arrow mode you have no idea

check fs and align mode

swap needs to tell alignMode because wrong image is being moved - seems ok now?

applyCrop probably doesn't have to call alignModeRestorePreviousScalePercent, except that when re-cropping, startCrop calls
  enterAlignMode, the previous scale is remembered incorrectly as the previous alignMode scale, so switching to side-by-side mode is using the alignMode scale
  
On the first crop, enterAlignMode captures the previous scale as the uncropped scale; so when switching to side by side mode, this is actually
  perchance OK because side by side mode also uses the uncropped scale.

need this?
        // prevent cropbox handles from being hidden when images are cut off at the top
        const leftY = cropBoxes[LEFT].y;
        let leftYOffset = cropBoxes[LEFT].yOffset;
        const rightY = cropBoxes[RIGHT].y;
        let rightYOffset = cropBoxes[RIGHT].yOffset;
        if (leftYOffset > leftY) {
            rightYOffset -= leftYOffset - leftY;
            leftYOffset = leftY;
            cropBoxes[LEFT].yOffset = leftYOffset;
            cropBoxes[RIGHT].yOffset = rightYOffset;
        }


========== Hard to fix and maybe not worth it (or both) ==========

Crop, since gap gets smaller on geese, scale size is too small, not optimal, can't even get it bigger with resize

Gap should only be in area between crop boxes

scroll bar beside image moves header to left in Chrome

reducing 1 from full display scale moves right filename and fullscreen icon to the left

May want to revert scale after fullscreen mode

Add 1/3 crop lines in align mode
