weird dotted lines on canvas on mobile
timeouts on fullscreen??
need fromFullScreenCanvas in case of ESC instead of pressing button
can't reproduce: mobile crop box up left cornere not working
Crop, apply, recrop - can set scale to same amt as after the apply

horizontal movement on dblClick or by default
image moves not crop box
