timeouts on fullscreen??
need fromFullScreenCanvas in case of ESC instead of pressing button
need to updatemovableboxes on entering and exiting fullscreen mode.
fullscreen on Firefox does weird things with moving the image down, does Chrome?
May not want to update crop scale after fullscreen mode

cursor changes on mobile? esp. with touch
^^^^^^^ try on chromebook
desktop, crop / resize, mobile, desktop, cancel, crop - crop window too small
^^^^^^^ try on chromebook

Update readme

Hard to fix and maybe not worth it:

Crop, since gap gets smaller on geese, scale size is too small, not optimal, can't even get it bigger with resize

Gap should only be in area between crop boxes

scroll bar beside image moves header to left in Chrome

reducing 1 from full display scale moves right filename and fullscreen icon to the left
