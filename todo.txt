timeouts on fullscreen??
need fromFullScreenCanvas in case of ESC instead of pressing button
need to updatemovableboxes on entering and exiting fullscreen mode.
fullscreen on Firefox does weird things with moving the image down, does Chrome?

clean up code that checks clamp mode before allowing box to move

clean up clamp stuff

cursor changes on mobile?
^^^^^^^ try on chromebook
desktop, crop / resize, mobile, desktop, cancel, crop - crop window too small
^^^^^^^ try on chromebook

why do both boxes blink when moving both outside
    // seems weird that only am setting axtiveCB in tweakXY
    // mismatch happens after diag movement, returning to vert or horizontal in final analysis

scroll bar moves header to left

Crop, since gap gets smaller on geese, scale size is too small, not optimal, can't even get it bigger with resize


check touch mode


Update readme

** new version **
  

gap should only be in area between crop boxes

should do  [ currentHandle, activeCropBox ] = [ OUTSIDE, LEFT ]; more often?
cursor not updating after mouseup - check places I removed the check

iPad left and right side of image not drawing corectly

May not want to update crop scale after fullscreen mode

Update scale on return from crop?

tweakXY boxes in canvas mode units
