need to updatemovableboxes on entering and exiting fullscreen mode.
  well how do onScaleChange and onSwap do it without calling movableboxes?

fullscreen on Firefox does weird things with moving the image down, does Chrome?

cursor changes on mobile? esp. with touch
^^^^^^^ try on chromebook
desktop, crop / resize, mobile, desktop, cancel, crop - crop window too small
^^^^^^^ try on chromebook

Update readme

iOS may need to call onResize after a timeout, as documented in MB:
    // ios is not always reporting correct width and height on orientation change
    // use timeout to redo the resize after things have hopefully settled down


Hard to fix and maybe not worth it (or both):

Crop, since gap gets smaller on geese, scale size is too small, not optimal, can't even get it bigger with resize

Gap should only be in area between crop boxes

scroll bar beside image moves header to left in Chrome

reducing 1 from full display scale moves right filename and fullscreen icon to the left

May want to revert scale after fullscreen mode
