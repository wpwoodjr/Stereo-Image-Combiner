weird dotted lines on canvas on mobile
timeouts on fullscreen??
need fromFullScreenCanvas in case of ESC instead of pressing button
some indication that the other box will move, like dotted green lines?
can't reproduce: mobile crop box up left cornere not working
does startcrop init activecropbox and currentHandle and movableboxes
Crop, apply, recrop - can set scale to same amt as after the apply
