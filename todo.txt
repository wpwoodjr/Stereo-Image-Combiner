==========  new code ===========

Try leaving transparent background on

why are the images always the same height?  Maybe better if height is always the same?  max height?

crop borders on single images too?

Sometimes borders/transparent in conflict

Toggle border cropping?

Set gap/border based on import?

Clean up processFiles

Apply a crop instead of actually cropping

Incorrectly splits full height when no gap

Why does it find additional border when reload? Maybe only when saved with a border?

======== old code ===========

Mac cropbox drawing all screwed up

Check drawImage in alignMode works with Safari

========== Maybe later ==========
thin line at 0% gap (but not in saved image)

Use currentparams for imgages[0].width etc
need currentScale?

Can remove yOffset?

only look at some mouse movements to decrease CPU?

move other box in side by side mode, like in align mode?

lines on shadow, maybe due to off by one issue?  timing?

want slow movement on resize handles?

duplicate tab in a mode or after a crop, display scale is from a mode or cropped scale, eg 72 instead of 100

iOS may need to call onResize after a timeout, as documented in MB:
    // ios is not always reporting correct width and height on orientation change
    // use timeout to redo the resize after things have hopefully settled down

cursor changes on mobile? esp. with touch
^^^^^^^ try on chromebook

*Align Mode*
need better indicators of what will move in align mode, esp arrow mode
  for instance the transparency isn't a clear indicator
  in arrow mode you have no idea

check fs and align mode

swap needs to tell alignMode because wrong image is being moved - seems ok now?

applyCrop probably doesn't have to call alignModeRestorePreviousScalePercent, except that when re-cropping, startCrop calls
  enterAlignMode, the previous scale is remembered incorrectly as the previous alignMode scale, so switching to side-by-side mode is using the alignMode scale
  
On the first crop, enterAlignMode captures the previous scale as the uncropped scale; so when switching to side by side mode, this is actually
  perchance OK because side by side mode also uses the uncropped scale.

need this?
        // prevent cropbox handles from being hidden when images are cut off at the top
        const leftY = cropBoxes[LEFT].y;
        let leftYOffset = cropBoxes[LEFT].yOffset;
        const rightY = cropBoxes[RIGHT].y;
        let rightYOffset = cropBoxes[RIGHT].yOffset;
        if (leftYOffset > leftY) {
            rightYOffset -= leftYOffset - leftY;
            leftYOffset = leftY;
            cropBoxes[LEFT].yOffset = leftYOffset;
            cropBoxes[RIGHT].yOffset = rightYOffset;
        }


========== Hard to fix and maybe not worth it (or both) ==========

Crop, since gap gets smaller on geese, scale size is too small, not optimal, can't even get it bigger with resize

Gap should only be in area between crop boxes

scroll bar beside image moves header to left in Chrome

reducing 1 from full display scale moves right filename and fullscreen icon to the left

May want to revert scale after fullscreen mode

Add 1/3 crop lines in align mode

cursor disappears after handling a keypress
