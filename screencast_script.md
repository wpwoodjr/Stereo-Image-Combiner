# Stereo Image Combiner - 5-Minute Screencast Script

## Introduction (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Show the app homepage with the title and drop zone
**Narration**: 
"Welcome to Stereo Image Combiner - a powerful web-based tool for creating stereo image pairs. Whether you have two separate images or a single stereo pair that needs splitting, this app makes it easy to align, crop, and combine images for cross-eyed or parallel viewing."

**Action**: Point to the GitHub link and mention it's open source and works entirely in your browser - no uploads required.

## Loading Images (45 seconds)
**Visual**: Demonstrate both loading methods
**Narration**: 
"Let's start by loading images. You can either drag and drop files directly onto the drop zone, or click to browse. The app handles both single stereo images that need splitting, and two separate images. Here I will drag and drop an image from Reddit's r/ParallelView, crop and align it, add a colorful border, convert it to cross view, and save it as a high quality JPEG."

**Actions**:
1. First, drag a single wide stereo image onto the drop zone
2. Show the automatic border detection and splitting in action
3. Point out the progress indicator: "Loading image... Finding image borders... Rendering images..."
4. Show the result with borders automatically cropped

**Key callout**: "Notice how it automatically detected and cropped the borders, and split the image into left and right parts."

## Basic Controls (60 seconds)
**Visual**: Show the control panel and demonstrate each feature
**Narration**: 
"Now let's explore the basic controls. The left panel gives you full control over your stereo image."

**Actions** (demonstrate each quickly):
1. **Swap Images**: Click swap button - "Use this to switch between cross-eyed and parallel viewing. For this demo, we will create a cross-eyed image."
2. **Display Scale**: Adjust slider - "Change the preview size without affecting final output"
3. **Gap Width**: Adjust slider - "Control the space between images from 0 to 20%"
4. **Color**: Change color picker - "Choose any color for the gap and borders"
5. **Borders**: Toggle checkbox - "Add matching borders around the images"
6. **Transparent**: Toggle checkbox - "Make gaps transparent for any background"
7. **Corner Radius**: Adjust slider - "Add rounded corners for a modern look"

**Key callout**: "All these settings are just for preview - your original images remain unchanged until you save."

## Advanced Cropping (2 minutes)
**Visual**: Enter crop mode and demonstrate both align and side-by-side modes
**Narration**: 
"Now for the most powerful feature - precision cropping with alignment tools."

**Actions**:
1. Click "Crop Images" button
2. **Align Mode demonstration**:
   - "By default, you're in align mode. The images are overlaid with inverse grayscale coloring."
   - Click and drag inside the crop box to move one image relative to the other
   - "Notice how the overlay helps you see misalignment - you want matching areas to appear gray."
   - "This is perfect for aligning the closest objects in your stereo pair."

3. **Resize demonstration**:
   - Drag corner handles: "Resize both crop boxes simultaneously while maintaining matching dimensions"
   - Drag edge handles: "Resize in just one direction"

4. **Toggle to side-by-side mode**:
   - Press 'a' key or uncheck "Align Mode"
   - "Now you can see exactly how your stereo pair will look"
   - Demonstrate moving crop boxes independently

5. **Keyboard shortcuts**:
   - Use arrow keys for pixel-perfect movement
   - Press Tab to cycle between left, right, and both images
   - Press 'h' for horizontal-only movement

**Key callouts**: 
- "The crop boxes always maintain the same dimensions"
- "Use align mode for precision alignment, side-by-side for final preview"

## Additional Features (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Show fullscreen and other features
**Narration**: 
"A few more helpful features:"

**Actions**:
1. Press 'f' or click fullscreen button - "Get a larger view for detailed work"
2. Show help button - "Complete documentation is always available"
3. Mention keyboard shortcuts: "Press '?' for a full list of shortcuts like 'x' to swap images"

## Saving and Final Output (45 seconds)
**Visual**: Demonstrate the save process
**Narration**: 
"When you're satisfied with your stereo pair, it's time to save."

**Actions**:
1. Click "Apply Crop" to confirm cropping
2. Make final adjustments to gap, borders, colors
3. Add filename prefix: "Add a prefix like 'Cross' or 'Parallel' to identify your images"
4. Choose format: "PNG for transparency support, JPG for smaller files"
5. For large images, show the scale dialog: "The app automatically offers size options for large images"
6. Click "Save Image" and show the download
